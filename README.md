# LightDI 🚀

LightDI is a lightweight, high-performance dependency injection container for .NET and Unity projects. It leverages Roslyn Source Generators to produce compile-time factories for constructor injection—**eliminating runtime reflection overhead** and delivering superior performance. While you can access the container directly via the `DiContainerProvider`, it is **strongly recommended** to use the generated factories and constructor injection for optimal efficiency.

> **Performance Note:**  
> Using the `[Inject]` attribute on constructor parameters ensures dependencies are resolved **without runtime reflection**, delivering a significant performance boost compared to field injection.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Compile-Time Injection:**  
  Automatically generate type-safe factories for classes decorated with `[Inject]`. Constructor injection is handled at compile time—no runtime reflection required!

- **Flexible Lifetime Management:**  
  Register services as either **Singletons** (one instance per container, lazily instantiated) or **Transients** (a new instance is created on every resolve).

- **Automatic Disposal:**  
  The container implements `IDisposable` and disposes all registered services implementing `IDisposable` when the container is disposed.

- **Global Container Management:**  
  Containers created via `DiContainerFactory` automatically register with the global `DiContainerProvider`.  
  > **Warning:** Direct calls to `DiContainerProvider.Resolve<T>()` should be used **only in critical cases**.

- **Extensibility & Future Enhancements:**  
  Designed for easy extension—fluent APIs, cycle detection, and sub-container (scoped) support can be added later.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Container Initialization

Use the `DiContainerFactory` to create a container that automatically registers itself with the global provider:

```csharp
using LightDI.Runtime;

public class CompositionRoot
{
    public void Enter()
    {
        // Create a new container and register it with DiContainerProvider.
        var container = DiContainerFactory.CreateContainer();

        // Register your dependencies.
        container.RegisterAsSingleton<IServiceA>(() => new ServiceA());
        container.RegisterAsSingleton<IWeapon>(() => new Sword());

        // Create your GameManager using the generated factory.
        // Constructor injection (with [Inject]) avoids reflection for optimal performance.
        var gameManager = GameManagerFactory.CreateGameManager(10);
        gameManager.RunGame();
    }
}


```

## 2. Registering Services

LightDI offers a straightforward approach to service registration, allowing you to specify whether a service should behave as a **Singleton** or as a **Transient**. Below you'll find examples that showcase how to register your services in a clean and efficient manner.

### 🔒 Singleton Registration

Register your services using simple methods:

```csharp
// Register as Singleton (a single instance is returned on every resolve)
container.RegisterAsSingleton<IMyService>(() => new MyService());

// Register an already created instance as Singleton
var existingService = new ExistingService();
container.RegisterAsSingleton<ExistingService>(existingService);

// Register as Transient (a new instance is created each time)
container.RegisterAsTransient<ILogic>(() => new SomeLogic());
```

## 3. Using `[Inject]` for Dependency Injection

LightDI leverages the `[Inject]` attribute to automatically inject dependencies into your classes. When you mark constructor parameters or fields with `[Inject]`, the Source Generator creates a factory that resolves these dependencies at compile time. This means:

- **Constructor Injection** avoids runtime reflection entirely, offering excellent performance.
- **Field Injection** is performed via reflection only when the dependency is not provided through the constructor.

### 🚀 Constructor Injection

When you decorate constructor parameters with `[Inject]`, LightDI generates a factory method that creates your object with its dependencies already provided—**without using reflection**. This leads to a significant performance boost.

```csharp
public class GameManager
{
    private readonly IServiceA _serviceA;
    private readonly int _runtimeValue;

    // Constructor injection: dependencies are provided directly.
    public GameManager([Inject] IServiceA serviceA, int runtimeValue)
    {
        _serviceA = serviceA;
        _runtimeValue = runtimeValue;
    }

    public void RunGame()
    {
        _serviceA.DoSomething();
        UnityEngine.Debug.Log($"GameManager running with runtime value: {_runtimeValue}");
    }
}
```

### 💥 Field Injection

If a dependency is not provided via the constructor, you can use field injection by applying [Inject] to a field. In this case, the generated factory injects the dependency via reflection. However, for performance reasons, constructor injection is always preferred.
```csharp
public class GameManager
{
    private readonly IServiceA _serviceA;
    private readonly int _runtimeValue;

    // Constructor injection for critical dependencies.
    public GameManager([Inject] IServiceA serviceA, int runtimeValue)
    {
        _serviceA = serviceA;
        _runtimeValue = runtimeValue;
    }

    // Field injection for additional dependencies.
    [Inject]
    private IWeapon _weapon;

    public void RunGame()
    {
        _serviceA.DoSomething();
        _weapon?.Attack();
        UnityEngine.Debug.Log($"GameManager running with runtime value: {_runtimeValue}");
    }
}
```

### 🔥 Example of a Generated Factory

A typical generated factory (e.g., GameManagerFactory.g.cs) might look like this:
```csharp
public static class GameManagerFactory
{
    public static GameManager CreateGameManager(int runtimeValue)
    {
        // Resolve constructor dependency without reflection.
        var serviceA = DiContainerProvider.Resolve<IServiceA>();
        var instance = new GameManager(serviceA, runtimeValue);
        
        // Field injection is performed via reflection if necessary.
        instance._weapon = DiContainerProvider.Resolve<IWeapon>();
        
        return instance;
    }
}
```

> **⚡ Performance Tip:**  
> Prefer **constructor injection** over field injection whenever possible—constructor injection avoids runtime reflection and results in **faster resolution**.
>
> **🚀 Efficiency Boost:**  
> Embrace the power of `[Inject]` in LightDI to achieve **clean, efficient dependency management** with minimal overhead!

## 4. Direct Resolution (Discouraged) 🚫

While you **can** resolve services directly using `DiContainerProvider.Resolve<T>()`, this approach is intended only for **critical or internal cases**. For everyday use, please rely on the generated factories and constructor injection to maintain performance and clarity.

```csharp
var service = DiContainerProvider.Resolve<IServiceA>();
```
> **💡 Tip: Direct resolution bypasses the benefits of compile-time injection, so it should be avoided in favor of using the generated factories.**

### 5. Disposal 🗑️

When your container is no longer needed (for example, when a scene is unloaded in Unity), make sure to call Dispose() on the container. This will:
- Dispose all registered services that implement IDisposable.
- Unregister the container from the global provider.
```charp
container.Dispose();
```
> **Remember: Proper disposal is key for managing resources and ensuring your application remains efficient.**

### Cycle Detection 🔄

Future enhancements will include cyclic dependency detection to catch infinite loops during service resolution. The container will track the chain of currently resolving types and throw a descriptive exception if a cycle is detected, helping you maintain a healthy dependency graph.

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Internal Access:
Generated factories are produced in a separate assembly, so accessing internal services may lead to visibility issues.
Recommendation: Either use public types or add an appropriate [InternalsVisibleTo] attribute in your assembly.

- Direct Resolve Usage:
Direct calls via DiContainerProvider.Resolve<T>() are available but are discouraged for regular use. Always prefer the compile-time generated factories and constructor injection.

- MonoBehaviour Support:
LightDI currently does not support dependency injection for MonoBehaviour classes. For Unity-specific DI with MonoBehaviours, consider using frameworks like Zenject or VContainer.
